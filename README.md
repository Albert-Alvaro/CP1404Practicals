# CP1404 Practical Repository

## Albert Alvaro, 14328932

This repository is used as a backup and submission for the practicals of subject code CP1404

- I have learned to use efficient pseudocode to streamline the coding process and create easy to understand code for someone viewing my code for the first time
- I have learned to keep my code as simple as possible without making it overly complicated, as complicated code tends to involve more parts that all has the chance to create an error.
- I have learned of the conveniences that function possess, not only that but the class system that is in python is also incredibly useful for the creation of clean and streamlined code in my opinion
