* regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject? 
> Yes it did, the margin of error for my time estimates for completion used to be as wide as an hour. However, as my experience increased the estimates of time I predicted grew more accurate.
* regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
>Most people seems to make the same mistakes, over and over again until they finally fix the bad habit that caused them to make that mistake.
This seems to take some time before it can actually happen, the same thing happened to me as well as I find myself making the same mistake
over and over until my bad habit was overcome
* regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
> I would try to find a good balance between challenging yet not so difficult as to put off or demotivate students. I would like to make it so that the practicals help with building up the foundations for doing the assignments that are to be assigned.
